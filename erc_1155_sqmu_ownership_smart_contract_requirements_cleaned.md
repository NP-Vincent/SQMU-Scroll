| **Standard**               | ERC-1155 (OpenZeppelin reference implementation; upgradable via proxy)                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Token Model**            | Each property is represented by a unique token ID with a fixed fractional supply per property (e.g., 1 token = 1 sqm).                                                                                                                   |
| **Minting and Burning**    | Only contract owner/platform may mint tokens (property onboarding/funding) and burn tokens (property removal/liquidation). Same property ID cannot be reminted after burn.                                                               |
| **Ownership/Bearer Model** | Tokens are held directly in user wallets (MetaMask/EVM-compatible); reflects bearer ownership.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Transfer Control**       | Direct wallet-to-wallet (peer-to-peer) transfers are allowed. Each transfer must include a platform commission fee (in ETH), enforced by contract logic. Receiving wallet must be KYC-verified (whitelisted). DEX transfers are blocked. |
| **Platform Fee Handling**  | Commission fee (in ETH) is calculated and enforced on every transfer; fee is automatically sent to the SQMU Treasury wallet.                                                                                                             |
| **KYC & Compliance**       | Only KYC-verified (whitelisted) wallets can receive tokens; platform is responsible for maintaining and updating the whitelist.                                                                                                          |
| **Operator Management**    | Owner/admin can add or remove platform operators (who may mint, burn, update metadata, or manage KYC); operator changes are recorded with events for auditability.                                                                       |
| **Pausing/Emergency Stop** | Admin can pause or unpause all transfers and minting (using a Pausable pattern) to respond to security or compliance requirements.                                                                                                       |
| **Access Control**         | Only owner/admin may mint, burn, manage operators, update metadata/URI, or pause contract functions.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Audit Trail**            | All mint, burn, transfer, fee payment, metadata updates, and operator changes emit events for full on-chain traceability and audit.                                                                                                      |
| **Upgradability**          | Required: Deployed behind upgradeable proxy (UUPS/Transparent Proxy pattern) to allow safe evolution of contract logic.                                                                                                                  |
| **Metadata Management**    | Each property token has a URI; metadata may be updated post-mint by owner/admin to add DLD attestation/hash and property details; all metadata changes must be logged for auditability.                                                  |
| **Regulatory Flexibility** | Freeze/blacklist functionality included as required by regulators or legal authorities.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Scalability**            | Designed for efficient handling of 100+ properties, 10,000+ users, and 100,000+ transactions without bottleneck.                                                                                                                         |
| **Gas Efficiency**         | Batch operations supported for minting, transfers, and burning to minimize gas costs.                                                                                                                                                    |
|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
